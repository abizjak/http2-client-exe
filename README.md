# http2-client-exe

A reference command-line client for 'http2-client'.

Allows testing the library but can sometimes come in handy for debugging
servers/load-balancer installation purposes.

See https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/http2-client for the library.

This binary is distributed as a separate package to avoid compiling
command-line interface clients when un-needed.
